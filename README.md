# Puppet Modules

This repository contains source code for Puppet modules for various Veeam solutions along with sample usage.

Puppet is a configuration management tool used to manage various stages of the IT infrastructure lifecycle, including _provisioning_, _patching_, _configuration_, and _management_ of operating system and application components across enterprise data centers and cloud infrastructures. There are both [paid](https://puppet.com/products/puppet-enterprise) and [open-source](https://puppet.com/download-open-source-puppet) versions of Puppet.
